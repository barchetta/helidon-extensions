<!--
Use in Helidon:
This file is used when running the aggregate report (and configuration in modules is ignored in that case).
This file SHOULD ONLY contain exclusions for whole modules where appropriate.
Single check exclusions should be handled through @SuppressWarning("checkstyle:....") annotation.

Only exceptional cases that cannot be handled through annotations may be provided here.
This is to keep the checkstyle exclusions co-located with the code, so if the code changes, we do not leave an outdated
record here.
